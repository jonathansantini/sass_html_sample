# HTML/SASS Code SAMPLE

Thank you for taking a look at my code sample for HTML and SASS.

Here is a description of the main folders and files to help explain the structure of this sample.

## css

The folder where main.css lives.  It is automatically rendered by all files in the scss folder.

## js

Javascript file folder to help support the toggling of the different sections of the cloud options tout.

## SCSS

Files used to generate css/main.css.  

main.scss only includes @import references to make it more readable and easy to update.

The sample uses touts to keep updating easy and the code easy to find.

## index.html

The main file for this code sample.  To view, just open it in any local browser.
