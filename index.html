              <div class="cloud-info__desc">
                <p>Making the minimum payments on your credit cards is a strategy that merely prolongs your problem. Given an average minimum payment representing just 3% of the total outstanding balance and an interest rate in the high teens, you can forecast paying off your entire balance in about 40 years. This scenario assumes that you will be making no additional purchases on your credit cards and you are making the monthly minimum payments on time each month.</p> <p>Minimum payments should be used only as a temporary strategy in advance of receiving a windfall cash payment that can be used to pay off your credit card debt. Otherwise you can expect total payments to the credit card companies to exceed 3 times your existing balance. As an example, if you have credit card balances of $40,000, by the time you pay it off in 40 years, you will have paid the credit card companies over $130,000 — $90,000 of which would be interest expense.</p> <p>If you have experienced a unexpected reduction in income and are only able to make the minimum payments, then this strategy may be an effective one in the short term, assuming you make all payments on time and expect to have increased future income or a significant cash windfall which you will use to pay down or pay off the outstanding balances. If the outstanding balance on any single account is greater than 30% of your total credit line available on that account, this strategy may actually be dragging down your credit score as credit rating agencies penalize you for carrying a high balance relative to your total available credit line on any given account.</p>

              <div class="cloud-info__desc">
                <p>Debt Resolution, or Debt Negotiation as it is sometime referred to, is the process of negotiating with a creditor or debt collector to pay less than the full amount owed. By paying less than the full balance you on an account to satisfy the debt, you are able to become debt free in a shorter period of time and get on with your life.</p> <p>This type of debt relief program is both recognized and regulated by the federal government. Debt relief providers who offer this type of service are prohibited by law from collecting fees in advance of actually resolving a debt to the benefit of the consumer. For this reason, this type of debt relief program has become more popular in recent years. While this program may provide significant payment relief, allowing you to become debt free sooner, your credit score may be negatively impacted by entering into an agreement to repay less than the full balance owed.</p> <p>However, if your credit score has already suffered due to months of late payments, maxed out credit card balances or closed and charged-off accounts, the damage to your credit score may already be done. If so, this option may help you get back on your feet and on your way to improving your credit score. Finally, under the new credit scoring algorithms recently implemented by the FICO credit scoring company, an account which has been paid off through a settlement no longer factors into your credit score, so long as the agreement has been satisfied and the account has been reported to the credit bureaus as “Settled in Full”. Therefore, the sooner you can settle and pay off a negotiated account, the sooner your credit score may improve.</p> <p>With your credit card debts successfully negotiated and paid off; a little time, and some regular payment activity on a few credit lines, will go a long way to improving your credit score.</p>

              <div class="cloud-info__desc">
                <p>Credit Counseling is a program that was designed in conjunction with the credit card companies. Credit Counseling provides consumers burdened with high interest credit card debt financial counseling, education tools, budgeting help and a reduction of the interest rate for the credit cards accepted in the program. In a Credit Counseling program, the outstanding balances on your credit card accounts are not reduced, but because the interest rate is lowered, a larger percentage of your monthly payment is being applied to the outstanding balance. Typically, a payment plan is established whereby you pay back 100% of the balance owed over a five year period.</p> <p>Credit Counseling companies are paid by the credit card companies, which creates a potential conflict of interest. If you have multiple credit cards, high balances and reduced or limited income, you may not be able to qualify for a Credit Counseling program or make the required payments in a timely manner to successfully complete the program. You will also not be allowed to continue to use your credit cards during the course of the program as the credit card companies will close the accounts once you enroll. However, if you want to pay back 100% of the account balances over a shorter period time, and you have the financial means to do so, while remaining current with all of your other debt obligations, then this may be an option you want to consider.</p>
